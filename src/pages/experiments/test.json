      "description": "To provide a more detailed survey of adaptive changes in the physiology of P. aeruginosa (PA) during long-term infection of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung, we performed a comparative proteome and transcriptome analysis of a set of isogenic sequential non-mutator and mutator isolates from three selected CF patients. Recently, we showed that during CF lung persistence PA mutators converge to a virulence-attenuated phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate that besides virulence-associated traits (VATs) the adaptation process of PA predominantly comprises metabolic pathways. In end-stage mutator strains, transcripts of genes encoding VATs, chemotaxis, degradation of aromatic compounds and several two-component regulatory systems were decreased. In contrast, several transcripts of genes or proteins involved in metabolism of fatty acids, nucleotides, amino acids and the generation of energy were increased. Of particular interest is the increased expression level of genes involved in (i) the anaerobic arginine-deiminase pathway, (ii) the anaerobic respiration such as nitrate-uptake protein OprF, redox-active azurin and cytchrome c551 peroxidase, (iii) the micro-aerobic respiration such as high oxygen-affinity cytochrome oxidase cbb3 (iv) the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), glyoxylate shunt and anaplerotic carboxylation reactions to oxaloacetate. Strikingly, an increased transcription of the anaerobic regulator gene anr correlates with the up-regulation of ANR-dependent genes. In conclusion, these changes in transcriptome and proteome indicate an adaptive shift towards constitutive expression of genes of metabolic pathways obviously required for growth under micro-aerobic and nutritional conditions of suppurative CF lung tissue. Finally, these results provide us with new targets for antimicrobial agents and biomarkers reflecting adaptation of PA towards progressive CF lung disease. Experiment Overall Design: P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from different time points of chronic cystic fibrosis lung disease were cultered in vitro, harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We compared the transcriptome (triplicate microarrays) of early non-mutator P. aeruginosa isolates with late mutator isolates with high mutation frequency probably the driving force of an efficient adaptation to changing environements to conclude from differences in gene expression to the requirements of CF lung environment.

      "description": "Although Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that does not often naturally infect alternate hosts such as plants, the plant-P. aeruginosa model has become a widely recognized system for identifying new virulence determinants and studying pathogenesis of this organism.  Here we examine how both host factors and P. aeruginosa PAO1 gene expression are affected in planta after infiltration into incompatible and compatible cultivars of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) Nicotiana tabacum has a resistance gene (N) against tobacco mosaic virus; and although resistance to PAO1 infection correlated to the presence of a dominant N-gene, our data suggests that it is not a factor in resistance against Pseudomonas. We did observe that the resistant tobacco cultivar had higher basal levels of salicylic acid, and a stronger salicylic acid response upon infiltration of PAO1. Salicylic acid acts as a signal to activate defense responses in plants, limiting the spread of the pathogen and preventng access to nutrients. It has also been shown to have direct virulence modulating effects on P. aeruginosa.  We also examined host effects on the pathogen by analyzing global gene expression profiles of bacteria removed from the intracellular fluid of the two plant hosts.  We discovered that the availability of micronutrients, particularly sulfate and Pi, are important factors in in planta pathogenesis, and that the amounts of these nutrients made available to the bacteria may in turn have an effect on virulence gene expression. Indeed, there are several reports suggesting that P. aeruginosa virulence is influenced in mammalian hosts by the availability of iron and by levels of O2. Experiment Overall Design: Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells were removed from leaf tissue 24 hours post-infiltration and RNA was directly extracted from these cells. Comparisons are between cells removed from a susceptible cultivar of Nicotiana tabacum (cv. Samsun) and a resistant cultivar (cv. Xanthi). Three biological replicates per cultivar were analyzed.",

We found that biofilms in our growth conditions express the type III secretion and these lifestyles are therefore not mutually exclusive in P. aeruginosa. Experiment Overall Design: Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells grown in five different conditions were analysed with three biological replicates for each sample. The five different conditions were planktonic cells in exponential phase, planktonic cells in stationary phase, colonies on agar plates incubated for 15 or 40 hours and biofilms in a continuous flow system after three days of growth.",

      "description": "Colistin is an important cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) in the fight against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection within the cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs. The effects of sub-inhibitory colistin on gene expression in P. aeruginosa were investigated by transcriptome microarray and functional analysis.  Analysis revealed an alteration in the expression of 60 genes in total from a variety of pathways.  Genes associated with bacterial chronic colonisation and virulence such as response to osmotic stress, motility, and biofilm formation, as well as those associated with LPS modification and quorum sensing are the most highly represented. Most striking among these is the upregulation of the PQS biosynthesis operon including pqsH, pqsE, and the anthranilate biosynthetic genes phnAB. Early activation of this central component of the QS-network may represent a switch to a more robust population, with increased fitness in the competitive environment of the CF-lung. Experiment Overall Design: Three independent cultures of the P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 were exposed to 0.15 µg colistin ml–1.  The untreated and treated samples were grown from OD600 0.05 to 0.8 and subsequently total RNA was extracted using the Ambion RiboPureTm- Bacteria kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",

      "description": "It has been proposed that the gastro-intestinal tract environment containing high levels of neuroendocrine hormones is important for gut-derived P. aeruginosa infections. In this study, we report that the hormone norepinephrine increases P. aeruginosa PA14 growth, virulence factor production, invasion of HCT-8 epithelial cells, and swimming motility in a concentration-dependent manner. Transcriptome analysis of P. aeruginosa exposed to 500 µM, but not 50 µM, norepinephrine for 7 h showed that genes involved in the regulation of the virulence determinants pyocyanin, elastase, and Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS, 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone) were up-regulated. The production of rhamnolipids, which are also important in P. aeruginosa infections, was significantly decreased on semi-solid surfaces, but not in planktonic cultures, upon exposure to norepinephrine. Swarming motility, a phenotype that is directly influenced by rhamnolipids, was also decreased upon 500 µM norepinephrine exposure. The increase in the transcriptional activation of lasR, but not that of rhlR, suggest that the effects of norepinephrine are mediated primarily through the las quorum sensing pathway. Together, our data strongly suggests that norepinephrine can play an important role in gut-derived infections by increasing the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa PA14. For growth rate measurements, a single colony of PA14 was grown overnight in Luria Bertini (LB) broth, and re-inoculated in serum-RPMI medium in the presence of 50 µM and 500 µM NE to an initial turbidity of ~ 0.05 at 600 nm. The turbidity of the cultures at 600 nm was monitored every hour and growth rate of the exponentially growing cultures was calculated. Growth curves were obtained in triplicate using three independent cultures, and the statistical significance of specific growth rate was determined using the unpaired Student’s t-test. Total RNA isolation and microarray analysis PA14 was grown overnight in LB to turbidity at 600 nm of ~5.0 and diluted in 100 mL of serum-RPMI medium to an initial turbidity at 600 nm of 0.05. Different concentrations of NE (50 µM or 500 µM) were added and the cultures grown for 7 hours till late exponential phase (turbidity at 600 nm of ~0.5, 1.1 and 1.5 with 0 µM, 50 µM and 500 µM NE, respectively). Cell pellets were prepared and RNA was isolated as described previously (Ren et al. 2004a). The P. aeruginosa Genome Array (Affymetrix, P/N 510596) containing 5,500 of the 5,570 open reading frames of P. aeruginosa PA01, was used to analyze changes in the PA14 transcriptome. cDNA synthesis, fragmentation and hybridizations were as described previously (Gonzalez Barrios et al. 2006). Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 50°C, and the total cell intensity was scaled to an average value of 500. The probe array images were inspected for any image artifact. Background values, noise values and scaling factors of all the arrays were examined and were comparable. The intensities of polyadenosine RNA control were used to monitor the labelling process. For each binary microarray comparison of differential genes expression, if the gene with the larger transcription rate did not have a consistent transcription rate based on the 13 probe pairs (P-value less than 0.05), these genes were discarded. A gene was considered differentially expressed when the P-value for comparing two chips was lower than 0.05 (to assure that the change in gene expression was statistically significant and that false positives arise less than 5%), and the expression ratio (between cells treated with NE and control) was greater than 4.0 for the 50 µM NE array and 2.0 for 500 µM NE array (based on the standard deviation of fold-change values) (Ren et al. 2004b). Gene functions and locus tag numbers were obtained from the Pseudomonas Genome Database (http://www.pseudomonas.com/download.jsp).",

      "description": "Next to the two-component and quorum sensing systems, cell-surface signaling (CSS) has been recently identified as an important regulatory system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CSS senses signals from outside the cell and transmits them into the cytoplasm. It consists of a TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor, a cytoplasmic membrane-localized sigma factor regulator (or anti-sigma factor), and an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor. Upon perception of the extracellular signal by the receptor the ECF sigma factor is activated and promotes the transcription of a specific set of gene(s). Although most P. aeruginosa ECF sigma factors are involved in the regulation of iron uptake, we have identified a novel ECF sigma factor (PA0675) involved in the regulation of virulence. By microarray analysis of cells overexpressing PA0675 from the pMUM3 plasmid we have identified the genes regulated by this sigma factor. Two different samples are analyzed namely P. aeruginosa (pMMB67EH) (control/reference sample) and P. aeruginosa (pMUM3) (overexpressing the PA0675 ECF sigma factor). Two different replicates per sample are included.",

      "description": "Anticipating the risk for infectious disease during space exploration and habitation is a critical factor to ensure safety, health and performance of the crewmembers. As a ubiquitous environmental organism that is occasionally part of the human flora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa could pose a health hazard for the immuno-compromised astronauts. In order to gain insights in the behavior of P. aeruginosa in spaceflight conditions, two spaceflight-analogue culture systems, i.e. the rotating wall vessel (RWV) and the random position machine (RPM), were used. Microarray analysis of P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown in the low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment of the RWV compared to the normal gravity control (NG), revealed a regulatory role for AlgU (RpoE). Specifically, P. aeruginosa cultured in LSMMG exhibited increased alginate production and up-regulation of AlgU-controlled transcripts, including those encoding stress-related proteins. This study also shows the involvement of Hfq in the LSMMG response, consistent with its previously identified role in the Salmonella LSMMG- and spaceflight response. Furthermore, cultivation in LSMMG increased heat- and oxidative stress resistance and caused a decrease in the culture oxygen transfer rate. Interestingly, the global transcriptional response of P. aeruginosa grown in the RPM was similar to that in NG. The possible role of differences in fluid mixing between the RWV and RPM is discussed, with the overall collective data favoring the RWV as the optimal model to study the LSMMG-response of suspended cells. This study represents a first step towards the identification of specific virulence mechanisms of P. aeruginosa activated in response to spaceflight-analogue conditions, and could direct future research regarding the risk assessment and prevention of Pseudomonas infections for the crew in flight and the general public. The wild type P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain (ATCC 15692) was used in this study and all cultures were grown in Lennox L Broth Base (LB) (Life Technologies) at 28 °C. An overnight shaking culture (125 r.p.m.) of P. aeruginosa in LB was washed and diluted in 0.85% NaCl solution to an OD600 of 1. This bacterial suspension was used to inoculate fresh LB medium at a final concentration of 10-4 CFU/ml. Synthecon Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactors (RWV) (50 ml or 10 ml) were filled with inoculated medium so that no headspace (i.e. no bubbles) was present. Other than for stress resistance assays, for which 10 ml capacity bioreactors were used, RWV bioreactors with a capacity of 50 ml were adopted for all experiments. Identical bioreactors were mounted in triplicate on (i) a RWV device in vertical position (LSMMG) (Cellon), (ii) a RWV device in horizontal position (NG) and (iii) the center of the inner Random Positioning Machine (RPM) frame (RG) (Fokker Space), and placed in a large humidified (70%-80% relative humidity) culture chamber, to avoid evaporation of culture medium through the gas-permeable membrane at the back of each vessel (Figure 1). A 25 r.p.m. rotation speed was adopted for the RWV cultures, while RPM-cultures were randomly rotated at 10 r.p.m. (60°/s). Bacteria were grown in the three described test conditions for 24 hours. After 24 hours of cultivation, the contents of every bioreactor was gently mixed by pipetting and divided into several aliquots. Ten millilitres of culture from each growth condition was immediately fixed with RNA Protect Reagent (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions, and fixed cell pellets were frozen at -20 °C until RNA extraction. Samples were immediately exposed to different stresses.",

      "description": "The anaerobic metabolism of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is important for growth and survival during persistent infections. The two Fnr-type transcription factors Anr and Dnr regulate different parts of the underlying network. Both are proposed to bind to a non-distinguishable DNA sequence named Anr box. The aim of this study was the identification of genes induced under anaerobic conditions in the P. aeruginosa wild type and identification of genes under control of the Anr or Dnr regulators. We performed three comparisons to identify genes induced under anaerobic denitrifying conditions in the P. aeruginosa wild type strain and genes which are under control of the Anr or Dnr regulators under these anaerobic conditions. Since the anr and dnr mutant strains do not grow under anaerobic denitrifying conditions, we applied anaerobic shift experiments.  Pseudomonas aeruginosa was grown in a modified AB minimal medium, containing 25 µM FeSO4, 20 mM glucose and 50 mM NaNO3. The 200 ml aerobic cultures were grown in 1 l Erlenmeyer flasks at 37 oC and 300 rpm. The aerobic culture was grown to an OD578 of 0.3. For the aerobic culture, cells were harvested at this point. For the anaerobic shift experiments 130 ml of the respective aerobic culture were transferred to a 135 ml sealed serum flask. Control experiments verified that oxygen tension decreased within 3 - 5 min below the detection limit of an oxygen electrode. The cells were harvested after incubation for additional 2h under anaerobic conditions. Within these 2h incubation period no growth of the wild type, the anr mutant or the dnr mutant strain was observed.  First comparison: Identification of genes induced or repressed under anaerobic conditions in the P. aeruginosa wild type PAO1. Here we compared the transcriptome profile of P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown under aerobic conditions up to an OD578 of 0.3 with the transcriptome profile of the PAO1 strain, which was first grown under aerobic conditions up to an OD578 of 0.3 and than shifted to anaerobic conditions by transfer to a sealed serum flask and further incubated for two hours under anaerobic conditions.  Second comparison: Identification of genes regulated differently in the anr mutant strain PAO6261. Here we compared the transcriptome profile of the P. aeruginosa wild type PAO1 with the transcriptome profile of the P. aeruginosa anr mutant strain PAO6261. Both strains were harvested after 2h incubation under anaerobic conditions.  Third comparison: Identification of genes regulated differently in the dnr mutant strain RM536. Here we compared the transcriptome profile of the P. aeruginosa wild type PAO1 with the transcriptome profile of the P. aeruginosa dnr mutant strain RM536. Both strains were harvested after 2h incubation under anaerobic conditions.",

      "description": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infection is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. In vitro models that closely mimic CF sputum are needed to improve understanding of the pathobiology of P. aeruginosa in the CF airway. We developed an artificial sputum medium (ASMDM) that more closely resembles the composition of CF sputum than current media. In order to validate the utility of ASMDM, we used GeneChip microarrays to compare expression data of P. aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 (PA14) in ASMDM with published data for this strain grown under the same conditions in an artificial medium containing 10% (v/v) CF sputum. Thirty-seven of 39 nutrition-related genes were differentially expressed in the same manner in both media. However, 24 quorum-sensing (QS) genes, 23 Type III secretion system and several anaerobic respiration genes were more highly expressed in ASMDM than in sputum-containing medium. When grown to stationary phase in ASMDM, PA14 differentially expressed about 50 biologically significant genes compared to stationary phase growth in Luria Broth; genes involved in iron acquisition (pfeA, fepC) and in assimilatory nitrate reduction (nasC, nirD) were upregulated, while 24 QS genes, including the regulator rhlR, lasA, rsaL, aprADEI and phenazine genes phzC2DD2EG2 were downregulated. Downregulation of QS-regulated virulence genes has been noted in chronic P. aeruginosa infection. ASMDM thus appears highly suitable for studies on gene expression of (i) P. aeruginosa strains from acutely and chronically infected CF patients and (ii) established biofilms that are a hallmark of advanced CF lung disease. PA14 was grown in four different ways: 1. Logarithmic growth for early gene expression  Cells were grown in MOPS-Glucose and separately in ASMDM. The average of two biological duplicates in each case was compared to the other to determine differential gene expression. 2. Stationary phase growth for gene expression Cells were grown in Luria Broth and separately in ASMDM. The average of two biological duplicates in each case was compared to the other to determine differential gene expression.",

      "description": "Intercellular signal indole and its derivative hydroxyindoles inhibit Escherichia coli biofilm and diminish Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence.  However, indole and bacterial indole derivatives were unstable in microbial community due to the widespread of diverse oxygenases that could quickly degrade them.  Hence, we sought to identify novel non-toxic, stable, and potent indole derivatives from plant sources for inhibiting biofilm formation of E. coli O157:H7 and P. aeruginosa PAO1.  Here, plant auxin 3-indolylacetonitrile (IAN) was found to inhibit biofilm formation of both E. coli O157:H7 and P. aeruginosa without affecting its growth.  IAN inhibited biofilms more effectively than indole for both E. coli and P. aeruginosa.  Additionally, IAN decreased the production of virulence factor pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa.  DNA microarray analysis indicated that IAN repressed genes involved in curli formation and glycerol metabolism, while IAN induced indole-related genes and prophage genes in E. coli.  It appears that IAN inhibits biofilm formation of E. coli by reducing curli formation and inducing indole production.  Furthermore, unlike bacterial indole derivatives, plant-originated IAN was stable in the presence of either E. coli or P. aeruginosa. For the microarray experiments, P. aeruginosa were inoculated in 25 ml of LB medium in 250 ml shake flasks with overnight cultures that were diluted 1:100.  IAN (100 μg/ml) dissolved in 25 μl DMSO or 25 μl DMSO alone as a control was added.  Cells were cultured in LB at 37C with 250 rpm shakingfor 5 hrs.  Cells were immediately chilled with dry ice and 95% ethanol (to prevent RNA degradation) for 30 sec before centrifugation in 50 ml centrifuge tubes at 13,000 g for 2 min; cell pellets were frozen immediately with dry ice and stored -80°C.  RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy mini Kit (Valencia, CA, USA).  RNA quality was assessed by Agilent 2100 bioanalyser using the RNA 6000 Nano Chip (Agilent Technologies, Amstelveen, The Netherlands), and quantity was determined by ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., DE, USA).",

      "description": "Phagocytosis and killing of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) is the major antipseudomonal host defense of vertebrates. By screening a transposon library of the clinical P. aeruginosa isolate TBCF10839 that can grow and replicate in PMNs, a mutant was identified that was most strongly sensitized to killing by PMNs. The inactivated gene PA1572 termed nadK1 was found to encode an ATP:NAD kinase. The transcriptomes of the TBCF10839 wild type and nadK1 mutant were investigated in the presence of PMNs or H2O2. Exposure to H2O2 led to diametrical mRNA expression profiles. H2O2-degrading enzymes were upregulated by wild type, but not by nadK1 mutant. This data demonstrates that NadK1 is crucial for the response of P. aeruginosa to reactive oxygen species. The transcriptomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa TBCF10839 wild type and nadK1 mutant were comparatively investigated in the presence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils or H2O2 in order to investigate the role of NadK1 in oxidative stress response. These samples represent test samples. The expression profile of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain TBCF10839 wild type cells, isolated from a Cystic Fibrosis patient, was investigated under standard growth conditions in batch culture in Luria broth (LB) with no treatment. These samples represent reference samples. All samples were analyzed in duplicate.",

      "description": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa chronically colonizes the lungs of individuals with CF, where it reaches high cell densities and produces a battery of virulence factors. Upon infection, a single strain of P. aeruginosa can colonize an individual’s lungs throughout his or her lifetime. To understand the evolution of P. aeruginosa during chronic lung infection, we conducted both genotypic and phenotypic analyses on clinical isogenic strains obtained from the lungs of three different individuals with CF. These strains were isolated over a period of approximately ten years and possess phenotypes that are commonly observed in isolates from the CF lung, such as the antibiotic resistant dwarf and mucoid phenotypes. Microarray analyses were carried out on isolates grown in a chemically defined medium that mimics the nutritional environment of the CF lung, synthetic CF sputum medium (SCFM). 17 clinically isolated P. aeruginosa strains from three individuals with CF (5 strains from individual P1, 7 strains from individual P2, 5 strains from individual P3). Two reference strains PAO1 and PA14. All experiments were biologically duplicated.",

Conventional applications of transcriptional profiling often compare two paired data sets that differ in a single experimentally controlled variable. In contrast this study obtained the transcriptome of a single biofilm state, ranked transcript signals to make the priorities of the population manifest, and compared rankings for a priori identified physiological marker genes between the biofilm and published data sets.  Two drip flow biofilm conditions with three replicates each:  (1) baseline control at 72hrs, (2) no treatment for 12 hours past baseline. Data from these two conditions were pooled",

      "description": "Characterization of bacterial behavior in the microgravity environment of spaceflight is of importance towards risk assessment and prevention of infectious disease during long-term missions. Further, this research field unveils new insights into connections between low fluid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process in vivo, and bacterial virulence. This study is the first to characterize the global transcriptomic and proteomic response of an opportunistic pathogen that is actually found in the space habitat, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall, P. aeruginosa responded to spaceflight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins, with Hfq identified as a global transcriptional regulator in the response to this environment. Since Hfq was also induced in spaceflight-grown Salmonella typhimurium, Hfq represents the first spaceflight-induced regulator across the bacterial species border. The major P. aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceflight conditions were the lecA and lecB lectins and the rhamnosyltransferase (rhlA), involved in the production of rhamnolipids. The transcriptional response of spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data of this organism grown in microgravity-analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology. Interesting similarities were observed, among others with regard to Hfq regulation and oxygen utilization. While LSMMG-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic metabolism, P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceflight adopted an anaerobic mode of growth, in which denitrification was presumably most prominent. Differences in hardware between spaceflight and LSMMG experiments, in combination with more pronounced low fluid shear and mixing in spaceflight when compared to LSMMG conditions, were hypothesized to be at the origin of these observations. Collectively, our data suggest that spaceflight conditions could induce the transition of P. aeruginosa from an opportunistic organism to potential pathogen, results that are of importance for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention, both during spaceflight missions and in the clinic. This study describes the transcriptional response of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to low-Earth orbit environmental conditions. Our aim was to assess whether the microgravity environment of spaceflight could induce virulence traits in P. aeruginosa. To this end, P. aeruginosa cultures were grown in space, and the expression profile was compared with ground control samples (both in biological triplicate). Two RWV samples also examined (did not re-analyze them, only compared the outputs).",

      "description": "Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism of bacterial gene regulation in response to increases in population density.   Production of small molecule QS signals, their accumulation within a diffusion-limited environment and their binding to the LuxR-type receptor trigger QS-controlled gene regulatory cascades. QS pathways mediated by acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) in Gram-negative bacteria are the best studied.  In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for example, binding of AHLs to their cognate receptors (LasR, RhlR) controls production of virulence factors, pigments, antibiotics and other behaviors important for its interactions with eukaryotic hosts and other bacteria.  We isolated a new small cyclopropane-containing fatty acid, lyngbyoic acid (1), as a major metabolite of the marine cyanobacterium, Lyngbya sp., collected off Fort Pierce, Florida.  The structure of 1 was determined by NMR, MS and optical rotation.  We screened 1 against four reporters based on AHL receptors from Vibrio fischeri (LuxR), Aeromonas hydrophila (AhyR), Agrobacterium tumefaciens (TraR) and P. aeruginosa (LasR) and found that 1 most strongly affected LasR.  We show, by using a defined set of reporters, that compound 1 acts both through the AHL-binding site of LasR and independent of it.   We also show that 1 reduces pyocyanin and LasB, both on the protein and transcript level, in wild-type P. aeruginosa, and that 1 directly inhibits LasB enzymatic activity.  Conversely, dodecanoic acid (11) increased pyocanin and LasB, demonstrating that 1 is a “tagged” fatty acid potentially resistant to β-oxidation. 1 mL Cultures of P. aeruginosa PAO1 were grown for 6h at 37 °C with shaking either in the presence of lyngbyoic acid (1 mM) or EtOH alone (10 μL) as a control.  RNA samples were obtained from one treated and one control culture, and were reverse transcribed, labeled and fragmented according to Affymetrix's protocol.  The two samples were hybridized in duplicate.",

      "description": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a threatening, opportunistic pathogen causing disease in immunocompromised individuals. The hallmark of P. aeruginosa virulence is its multi-factorial and combinatorial nature. It renders such bacteria infectious for many organisms and it is often resistant to antibiotics. To gain insights into the physiology of P. aeruginosa during infection, we assessed the transcriptional programs of three different P. aeruginosa strains directly after isolation from burn wounds of humans. We compared the programs to those of the same strains using two infection models: a plant model, which consisted of the infection of the midrib of lettuce leaves, and a murine tumor model, which was obtained by infection of mice with an induced tumor in the abdomen. All control conditions of P. aeruginosa cells growing in suspension and as a biofilm were added to the analysis. We found that these different P. aeruginosa strains express a pool of distinct genetic traits that are activated under particular infection conditions regardless of their genetic variability. The knowledge herein generated will advance our understanding of P. aeruginosa virulence and provide valuable cues for the definition of prospective targets to develop novel intervention strategies. Samples collected from human burn wounds were stabilized and used for P. aeruginosa RNA extraction. The strains from burn wound infection were later used for infection models namely plant and murine tumor infection as well as rich medium controls with planctonic and biofilm growth. The RNA was treated for bacterial RNA enrichment and amplification. All samples were treated in the same way.",

      "description": "LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs) are emerging as key circuit components in regulating microbial stress responses and are implicated in modulating oxidative stress in the human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The oxidative stress response encapsulates several strategies to overcome the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species. However, many of the regulatory components and associated molecular mechanisms underpinning this key adaptive response remain to be characterised. Comparative analysis of publically available transcriptomic datasets led to the identification of a novel LTTR, PA2206, whose expression was altered in response to a range of host signals in addition to oxidative stress. PA2206 was found to be required for tolerance to H2O2 in vitro and lethality in vivo in the Zebrafish embryo model of infection. Transcriptomic analysis in the presence of H2O2 showed that PA2206 altered the expression of 58 genes, including a large repertoire of oxidative stress and iron responsive genes, independent of the master regulator of oxidative stress, OxyR. Contrary to the classic mechanism of LysR regulation, PA2206 did not autoregulate its own expression and did not influence expression of adjacent or divergently transcribed genes. The PA2214-15 operon was identified as a direct target of PA2206 with truncated promoter fragments revealing binding to the 5’-ATTGCCTGGGGTTAT-3’ LysR box adjacent to the predicted -35 region. PA2206 also interacted with the pvdS promoter suggesting a global dimension to the PA2206 regulon, and suggests PA2206 is an important regulatory component of P. aeruginosa adaptation during oxidative stress. Six samples were analysed in total, three biological replicates of the PA2206 mutant and PA2206 complemented strains. Each biological replicate included three technical replicates.",

We have discover that one of the most abandon molecule produced by the pqs operon, 2 aminoacetophenone (2-AA), a volatile molecule serves as a unique signal. In contrast to the previous described PQS and HHQ, 2-AA is downregulating virulence and acute phase proteins and upregulating chronic phase proteins. In addition we have found that 2-AA promotes the formation of persisters cells that antibiotic tolerant. we have compared the genes profile of wild-type PA14 strain and its derivatives topA which lacks Topoisomerase I and pqsA that do not produces HAQs or 2-AA to cultures that were treated with 3mM of 2-AA. Cell were grown with and without 2-AA (3mM) to OD 2.0.",
