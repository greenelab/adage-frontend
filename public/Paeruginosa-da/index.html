    <h3>Activity patterns of Node42</h3>
    <p>
      We provide a collection of heatmaps describing Node42’s activity pattern
      in each experiment covered in our compendium. Each experiment was named by
      its ArrayExpress ID. The activity values in each dataset were
      mean-centered and the complete range of node activity values was used to
      generate the color range.

    <h3>Differential node activities</h3>
    <p>
      We also provide a collection of heatmaps showing each node’s activity
      pattern in each experiment covered in our compendium. An experiment may be
      analyzed through nodes that are differentially active between cases and
      controls. To clearly visualize the differences in node activity, each
      node’s activity was adjusted by subtracting the node’s mininum activity in
      one experiment. Heatmaps were hierarchically clustered and the color key
      was automatically generated based on the range of activity differences.
