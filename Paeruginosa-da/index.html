  <h1>Supplement for the ADAGE-<i>P.aeruginosa</i> paper</h1>
  <p>This page provides supplemental materials for the paper “ADAGE analysis of
     publicly available gene expression data collections illuminates
     <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>-host interactions.”</p>
  
  <a href="node42/index.html"><h2>Activity patterns of Node42</h2></a>
  <p>We provide a collection of heatmaps describing Node42’s activity
     pattern in each experiment covered in our compendium. Each experiment
     was named by its ArrayExpress ID. The activity values in each dataset
     were mean-centered and the complete range of node activity values was used
     to generate the color range.</p>
  
  <a href="activity_heatmaps/index.html"><h2>Differential node 
    activities</h2></a>
  <p>We also provide a collection of heatmaps showing each node’s activity
     pattern in each experiment covered in our compendium. An experiment may
     be analyzed through nodes that are differentially active between cases
     and controls. To clearly visualize the differences in node activity, each
     node’s activity was adjusted by subtracting the node’s mininum
     activity in one experiment. Heatmaps were hierarchically clustered and
     the color key was automatically generated based on the range of activity
     differences.</p>
